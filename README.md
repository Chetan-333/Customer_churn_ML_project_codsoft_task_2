Customer Churn Prediction 🧠📊

This project focuses on building a Machine Learning model to predict customer churn based on a bank dataset. The objective is to identify customers who are likely to stop using the service, enabling the company to take preventive actions.

Dataset Description 📁

Total records: ~10,000

Churned customers: ~2,100

Class balance: Roughly 4:1 (non-churned : churned)

No missing or null values were found in the dataset.

All features were already numerical, so no categorical encoding was required.


Model Development 🔧

Various ML algorithms were implemented:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest


Initial results show a maximum accuracy of around 85% on the test set using Random Forest.

Confusion matrix and F1 scores were also evaluated.


> Note: The model is still under improvement and further tuning or feature engineering may enhance performance.



Tools & Libraries 🛠

Python 🐍

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn
